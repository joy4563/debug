          1. What is the difference between map, forEach , filter and find?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-2xl text-justify">
          The main difference between map() and forEach() is the returning
          value. The forEach() method returns undefined and map() returns a new
          array. <br />
          filter() returns an array all the element that satisfies the
          condition, but find() return the first element that satisfies the
          condition.

          2. What is the difference between Local Storage, Session Storage and
          Cookies?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-2xl text-justify">
          It is a web storage method that helps us store data on the clientâ€™s
          computer in the form of key/value pairs in a web browser. The data is
          stored in local storage for a lifetime unless the user manually
          deletes it from the browser. It does not expire even when the user
          closes the window or tab. Instead, the data remains in the browser
          until and unless the browser's memory is cleared.<br />
          <br />
          It is very similar to the local storage. Still, the main difference
          lies in the lifespan as it persists in the browser until its current
          tab is on. Once you close the tab or terminate it, the data on session
          storage also gets lost. <br />
          <br />
          A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on the user's
          computer. Cookies are used to store information about the user such as
          their name, password, and preferences. Cookies are created using the
          document.cookie property. This property is used to set, get, and
          delete cookies.

          3. What is Event loop and how it is work?
        </h2>
        <p class="text-2xl text-justify">
          The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear
          before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once
          the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue
          for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call
          Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the
          same process.
